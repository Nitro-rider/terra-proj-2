learning how to use terraform modules to get a code base in terraform established.


I am having trouble with the acm module. I believe it is because I have not alowed any hosted zones or set up any route53 configuration. Not to confident with setting up certificate, the different record specifications. Also having trouble with the NameCheap UI and setting up pointing traffic to AWS instead of default NameCheap records. check out Rahul Wagh (ACM) AWS certificae manager course | route53 | load balancer video on youtube for good information  the AWS side of things. This manual cinfiguration video may be helpful in understanding how the certification process works, then i can move on to how i automate this config.
